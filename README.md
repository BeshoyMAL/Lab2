Web-based Mastermind game
Each game allows up to 8 guesses. The player sees the color balls on the screen, from which he drags four per guess then submits the guess. The computer outputs the number of correct colors and correct guesses and keeps track of the history on the screen for the player to advance on their next attempt. If the player fails after the 8th attempt the game terminates.
